Programming Assignments in Undergraduate Course "Database Systems" at Department of Informatics & Telecommunications - NKUA 

A low level example of a hash-based primary index. Developed in C, this project provides a static hashtable infrastructure,
implemented on disc block-level (using university provided libraries) which can be used to create a disc embedded index for fixed entry size databases.

The first project, was an introduction to the provided libraries, while the second is the implementation described above.

The course contains a third, more advanced and complex project, on dynamic B+ tree based indices, frequently assigned with the same requirements through the years.
In order to avoid becoming an online source, that can "affect" the code of younger students with the same assignment, it was decided to keep it commited privately.

Currently, all descriptions and README files, are left as submitted, written in greek.
Later on, given the proper inspiration, they might be translated in english too.
